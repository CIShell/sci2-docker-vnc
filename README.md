# Sci2 Docker container with VNC

Sci2 in a Docker container accessed via VNC (over HTTP)

This Github repository contains resources for building Docker image based on Ubuntu containing Sci2, Gephi and VNC. If you are a Sci2/Gephi user, you don't need to build an image yourself. The associated image is already available on [Docker Hub][docker-hub-repo] and can directly be run using `docker run` command. The details are provided in the **Running Sci2 container in background** section.

Running a container bundled with Sci2 and Gephi in background so that the users don't have to install these softwares on their local system is the primary use-case for building this image. The container, once run, can be used directly from any modern web browser over VNC.

The image contains the following components:
- light-weight desktop environment
- Sci2 and Gephi applications accessible through Desktop links
- popular text editor vim
- lite but advanced graphical editor mousepad

## Running Sci2 container in background

Docker is required for running the container. Steps to install and get Docker running on Windows systems are available [here][install-docker-for-win]. For Mac users, they are available [here][install-docker-for-mac].

Once Docker is running, open terminal and execute the following command.
```
docker run -d -p 6901:6901 -v ~/Downloads:/home/headless/Dropbox -t cnsiu/sci2-vnc
```
The command will download the container image from Docker's image repository, and run the container in background. It also run an HTML5 client on TCP port **6901** and exposes it to be accessed by a browser on the host system. In addition, it mounts `~/Downloads` directory in the host system to a volume (also visible as a directory) `/home/headless/Dropbox` in the container OS. Mounting basically creates a bridge between the host's file system and the container's file system, so the files in `~/Downloads` are accessible via volume `/home/headless/Dropbox` in the container. You can change these mapped directories to other locations in the command to suit your needs.

You can see all the containers running in the background using `docker ps` command.

To be able to use the container over VNC, any modern web browser needs to be used. Chrome, Firefox, Safari or Microsoft Edge are supported browsers.

Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:6901/vnc.html?password=headless` and click on `Connect` button to access the container's desktop environment. If you are not using your local system, specify NAS path of the host system instead of localhost.

Click the slider visible nearby Gephi icon in the above image. noNVC configuration options should be accessible now. Click on `Settings` and change the `Scaling mode:` to `Remote Resizing`. This will maximize the GUI window to fill up all the space in the browser window. There is also a button to toggle FullScreen mode.

## Stopping the container
Execute `docker ps` to list all the running containers. Stop the container with `docker stop` command using the first 4 characters of the CONTAINER_ID associated with image `cnsiu/sci2-vnc` as shown in the image below.

## Credits
Dockerfile used for building Sci2 image has been adapted from [accetto][accetto-ubuntu-vnc-xfce]'s Dockerfile for building a base image with VNC server. Thanks to [accetto][accetto-ubuntu-vnc-xfce] for making his code available to public!
